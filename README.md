# The Movie Saga Web App!

## Description

Duration: 15hrs

This web application is a full-stack movie list that the user can populate themselves! The home page displays the user's favorite movies in grid format. The movie's poster is displayed along with a 'Go to Details' button that navigates the user to a details page for that specific movie. The details page displays movie title, poster, description, and genres. This is the perfect web application for someone to reference back to when it is time for movie night! The user can delete movies from the list if there was an error to the input information, or they just no longer like the movie!
